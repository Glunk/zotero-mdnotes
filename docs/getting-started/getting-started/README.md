# Quick-Start Guide

## Configure mdnotes

In `Tools > Mdnotes preferences` set the starting path.

## Export a Zotero item or notes to markdown

Right-click on the item or Zotero note \(the yellow ones\) you want to export, and select `Export to markdown`.

## Create a file for your own notes

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** This is only available for the `Split file` file organization. Check your [configuration](configuration.md).
{% endhint %}

Select a Zotero item, right-click and select `Create mdnotes file` or `Create a standalone note`. You can read what each of those do [here](../../customization/templates.md#mdnotes-default-template).

## Batch export all metadata and notes

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** This is only available for the `Split file` file organization. Check your [configuration](configuration.md).
{% endhint %}

Selecting a Zotero item, and choosing the menu `Batch export to markdown` will create the markdown files for the metadata, export all Zotero notes and create a file for your own notes.

## Customize how your export looks by adding templates

In `Tools > Mdnotes preferences` set the template directory. Read more about [templates](../../customization/templates.md) and [placeholders](../../customization/placeholders.md)

## Customize how a field looks like

Mdnotes has some hidden preferences to add custom formatting, e.g. only add links to collections, or export tags exactly as they look in Zotero. Check out the [formatting](../../customization/formatting.md) page for more info.
